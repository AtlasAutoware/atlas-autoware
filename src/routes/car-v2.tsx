            Car one taught us what breaks. For car two we designed the electronics ourselves: a
            motor controller with a built-in battery pack, a custom carrier board for the NVIDIA
            Jetson, and a 3D-printed carbon-fiber kit that holds it all together.

            These are renders straight from our design files, not photos. The parts we buy rather

            haven't ordered the parts yet, and that's what the fundraiser is for.
